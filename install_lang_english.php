define('_1ST_POST2',	'<b>Home - <a href=\"http://nucleuscms.org/\" title=\"Nucleus CMS home\">nucleuscms.org</a></b><br /> Welcome to the world of Nucleus CMS. In 2001 a set of PHP scripts were let loose on the open Internet. Those scripts, which took user-generated data and used it to dynamically create html pages, contained the ideas and the algorithms that are the core of today\\\'s Nucleus CMS. Though Nucleus CMS 3.5 is far more flexible and powerful than the scripts from which it emerged, it still expresses the values that guided its birth: flexibility, security, and computational elegance.<br /> <br /> Thanks to an international community of sophisticated developers and designers, Nucleus CMS remains simple enough for anyone to learn, and expandable enough to allow you to build almost any website you can imagine. Nucleus CMS lets you integrate text, images, and user comments in a seamless package that will make your web presence as serious, professional, personal, or fun as you want it to be.
